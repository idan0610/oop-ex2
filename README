SpaceShip.java - implements the general SpaceShip class
SpaceShipFactory.java - initiates new SpaceShip objects with the right types according the command arguments.
Human.java - implements the Human SpaceShip
Runner.java - implements the Runner SpaceShip
Basher.java - implements the Basher SpaceShip
Aggressive.java - implements the Aggressive SpaceShip
Drunkard.java - implements the Drunkard SpaceShip
Special.java - implements the Special SpaceShip

=          Design           =
=============================
I made the SpaceShip class abstract because a general SpaceShip does not exist in the game. All the types of
SpaceShip has a unique behavior. The only abstract method of SpaceShip is DoActions() which defines the
behavior of the SpaceShip. It's very easy to add new SpaceShip type. All that needs to be done adding a new
class to the directory where all the types are located that inherits SpaceShip class and implements the 
DoActions() and maybe more helper methods or even override the existing methods of SpaceShip if necessary
(like Human override the getImage() method to represent the Human SpaceShip with its unique images).

=============================
Except the minimal API required by the instructions, I added 3 new simple methods: getShieldStatus() to find
out if the shield of the SpaceShip is on or off, ShieldOff() to turn off the shield, and addEnergy() to add
energy to the SpaceShip.

=============================
The Drunkard SpaceShip decide in random to which direction to turn, and makes the turn for 50 rounds, and
then decide a new random turn. It will always accelerate. It also fire in random all the time, without
marking a specific SpaceShip to target.

The Special SpaceShip pursues other ships and when its distance from another ship is 0.4 units, it will
start to fire. If the distance from the other ship is 0.2, the Special spaceship stop to fire.
It will try to teleport if the distance from another ship is 0.2. It will also attempt to turn on its shield 
if its distance from another ship is 0.1 units (in case the teleport was not success).
